This article explains how to set values in the database to provide DHCP-handling for staticDHCPd's clients.

== Background ==
Knowledge of how to maintain databases using the engine you've chosen is a necessary pre-requisite.

== <tt>subnets</tt> table ==
At least one entry in this table is required before any values can be added to the maps table.

 * The <tt>subnet</tt> field may be a little misleading. While it's generally a good idea to use a value like <tt>192.168.0.0/24</tt> so you know, at a glance, what subnet its clients should be on, it is perfectly legal to set a value like <tt>my subnet</tt>.
 * The <tt>serial</tt> field may be used to separate a subnet into partitions to do things like set different default gateways to reduce load on servers.
 * The <tt>lease_time</tt> field contains the number of seconds for which clients will believe their "leases" to be valid; by default, <tt>T1</tt> is half of this, so the staticDHCPd server will be hit twice as often as you may think.
 * The <tt>gateway</tt> value may be an IPv4 or may be NULL to avoid setting the corresponding DHCP option.
 * The <tt>subnet_mask</tt> value may be an IPv4 or may be NULL to avoid setting the corresponding DHCP option.
 * The <tt>broadcast_address</tt> value may be an IPv4 or may be NULL to avoid setting the corresponding DHCP option.
 * The <tt>ntp_servers</tt> value may be up to three IPv4s, separated by commas, or may be NULL to avoid setting the corresponding DHCP option.
 * The <tt>domain_name_servers</tt> value may be up to three IPv4s, separated by commas, or may be NULL to avoid setting the corresponding DHCP option.
 * The <tt>domain_name</tt> value may be any arbitrary, FQDN-valid string or may be NULL to avoid setting the corresponding DHCP option.

== <tt>maps</tt> table ==
Every entry in this table must be bound to a subnet/serial pair in the subnets table, from which options will be inherited.

 * The <tt>mac</tt> value must be a lower-case, colon-separated MAC address.
 * The <tt>ip</tt> value must be a dot-separated IPv4 address without any unnecessary 0s.
 * The <tt>hostname</tt> value may be a string or may be NULL to avoid setting the corresponding DHCP option.
 * The <tt>subnet</tt> value must correspond to an entry in the subnets table.
 * The <tt>serial</tt> value must correspond to an entry in the subnets table.
