conf.py is the only thing you need to modify in order to have almost full
control over your DHCP server's behaviour.

The file is intended to be largely forwards-compatible, meaning that, when a new
version of staticDHCPd is released, you shouldn't have to change anything: the
new engine will massage and inject data as needed to make sure that gaps in your
configuration will be filled with sane defaults, and that old scripting logic
will still work. (Within reason, of course; always check the changelog)

The default file is very minimal in nature. To extend it, simply place the
parameters, described below, that you want to modify into that file and restart
your server.


conf.py is, as you may have guessed, a real Python file. It is executed by the
interpreter before staticDHCPd is fully online and you can do, with it,
everything that you'd normally expect a Python script to do, including importing
other modules. More information on that is provided in the scripting guide --
the important thing to note for basic configurations is that you need to conform
to Python syntax when specifying values:
 - None, written capitalised and without quotation, indicates that a value is
   explicitly null
 - Text values must be strings, "like this" or 'like this', with quotation marks
 - Numbers are written normally, like 6 or 7.32
 - Boolean values are written as True or False, capitalised, without quotation
 - Lists are written like [1, 2, 'hello'], and may contain other data-types
 - Concatenations of strings may be done using the + operator, like
   'hello' + 'goodbye' -> 'hellogoodbye'; non-string data, like numbers, must be
   converted, like 'hello' + str(5)
 - Any value defined in the file may be referenced later, like the following:
     _HELLO = 'hello'
     GREETING = _HELLO + 'goodbye'
 - Everything is case-sensitive
 
You may define non-config-parameter values in this file, but it would be a good
idea to prefix their names with an underscore, to avoid potential future
conflicts.


PARAMETERS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
General
----------------------------------------
DEBUG : boolean : default=False
 - Adds additional information to everything that gets logged
 - Does not modify the logging severity levels of individual loggers
 
SYSTEM_NAME : text : default='staticDHCPd'
 - The name the system will use to self-identify
 
DAEMON : boolean : default=True
 - Causes the server to daemonise during startup
 - Not a good idea when doing initial setup because you lose ^C and console logs
 
PID_FILE : text, None : default=None
 - The path to which a pidfile should be written
 - '/var/run/staticDHCPd.pid' is a good choice
 - Do not set this if using the Debian initscript; it is unnecessary

Server
----------------------------------------
UID : integer : MUST BE SPECIFIED
 - The UID under which the server will run, after everything is bound
 - This should normally be your system's "nobody"
GID : integer : MUST BE SPECIFIED
 - The GID under which the server will run, after everything is bound
 - This should normally be your system's "nobody"
 
DHCP_SERVER_IP : text : MUST BE SPECIFIED
 - The IP of the interface to use for DHCP traffic
 - This value must be a specific IP address: 0.0.0.0 is invalid
 
DHCP_SERVER_PORT : integer : default=67
 - The port on which to listen for DHCP queries
 
DHCP_CLIENT_PORT : integer : default=68
 - The port on which to respond to DHCP clients
 
PXE_PORT : integer, None : default=None
 - The port to use for PXE-processing, if required
 - PXE normally runs on 4011


Database
----------------------------------------
DATABASE_ENGINE : text, None : MUST BE SPECIFIED
 - The database-engine to use for handling static lease data
   - None, 'SQLite', 'PostgreSQL', 'Oracle', 'MySQL', 'INI'
 - Only parameters related to the chosen database engine need to be supplied
 - You may alternatively supply a callable that returns an instance of
   databases.generic.Database, if you want to implement your own engine without
   messing with core code
   - The callable must require no arguments
   - To keep conf.py clean, define your engine in a separate module, like
     extensions/_mydb.py and import it just before DATABASE_ENGINE is set,
     referencing a function declared therein
   - If you need to configure it differently for each server, declare a lambda
     or short function in conf.py and make changes to that as needed
   - It is sane to inherit from subclasses like CachingDatabase or the SQL
     family
   - If you need to tie into callbacks, like reinitialisation, you should do
     this as part of the callable's logic; the callbacks object is not available
     at the time that conf.py is first processed, but it is available while the
     callable is executed
     - Alternatively, you can create the object at the conf.py level, write a
       simple "lambda : _MY_INSTANTIATED_DATABASE_OBJECT" as the callable, and
       operate on _MY_INSTANTIATED_DATABASE_OBJECT in init(), for consistency
     - Note: the database object's reinitialise() method is automatically
       registered, so you only need to tie into callbacks if you need behaviour
       that cannot be captured there
       
Database:None
------------------------------
No parameters here: this database is only useful if you are exclusively using
handleUnknownMAC(), described in the scripting guide, to provision addresses.

Database:SQLite
------------------------------
USE_CACHE : boolean : default=False

   cache is flushed via reinitialisation
 - For SQLite, this should normally be False

 - Causes the local cache to be managed as a local SQLite file, rather than a
   purely in-memory construct
   - Most kernels will keep the file in memory if accessed frequently, but
     SQLite's data-compaction is a little bit tighter, and the cache should
     reach its final state quickly, so reclaiming memory is swap-free
   - This file will be temporary, unless PERSISTENT_CACHE is set; in that case,
     the file will be the same
 - For SQLite, this should normally be False
 
PERSISTENT_CACHE : text : default=None
 - Causes the cache to be written to a local SQLite file, which will be used
   when staticDHCPd is restarted, to provide durability against unstable
   databases
 - The value of this option is the path to the file;
   '/var/tmp/staticDHCPd.sqlite3' is recommended
 - If CACHE_ON_DISK is set, this file will be used; if not, the contents of
   this file will be read into memory
 - For SQLite, this should normally be False

ALLOWED_DHCP_RELAYS : list : default=[]
 - If relayed requests are allowed, providing a list of IPs, like
   ['192.168.1.1', '192.168.2.1'], will limit which ones will be accepted
 - If empty, all relays are considered acceptable
 
AUTHORITATIVE : boolean : default=False
 - Controls whether unknown MACs should be NAKed instead of ignored
 - If you are likely to run multiple DHCP servers that do not share the same
   lease-status information, this should be False, or else clients will
   experience intermittent stability issues, as one server contradicts the other
   instead of staying silent
   
NAK_RENEWALS : boolean : default=False
 - Whether REBIND and RENEW requests should be NAKed when received, forcing
   clients to either wait out their lease or return to the DISCOVER phase
 - This is good if you expect that you will be changing your configuration
   in the near future
   
UNAUTHORIZED_CLIENT_TIMEOUT : integer : default=60
 - The number of seconds for which unknown MACs should be ignored, to avoid
   wasting processing resources unnecessarily
   
MISBEHAVING_CLIENT_TIMEOUT : integer : default=150
 - The number of seconds for which MACs that are sending invalid requests should
   be ignored; with dynamic servers, these could be trying to trigger a DoS
   scenario, so there's no point in wasting resources on them
   
ENABLE_SUSPEND : boolean : default=True
 - Whether MACs that are flooding the server will be considered as misbehaving
 
SUSPEND_THRESHOLD : integer : default=10
 - The number of times a well-behaved MAC can interact with the server before
   being being considered as misbehaving
 - The number of interactions in memory is reduced by one per second

 
Logging
----------------------------------------
LOG_FILE : text, None : default=None
 - The path to which logs should be written
 - The specified file must be writeable if it already exists, or containing
   directory must allow file-creation
 - '/var/log/staticDHCPd/staticDHCPd.log' is a good choice, but you must create
   the directory and set appropriate permissions first
   
LOG_FILE_HISTORY : integer, None : default=7
 - If logging to a file, this will cause logs to rotate once per day, with
   retention up to the specified number of days
 - If None, which is not recommended, the specified file will grow indefinitely
 
LOG_FILE_SEVERITY : text : default='WARN'
 - Controls how much information appears in the log-file: only events at least
   this important
 - One of 'DEBUG', 'INFO', 'WARN', 'ERROR', 'CRITICAL'
 
LOG_CONSOLE_SEVERITY : text : default='INFO'
 - Controls how much information appears in the console: only events at least
   this important

 - Controls how much information appears in the dashboard: only events at least
   this important
 - One of 'DEBUG', 'INFO', 'WARN', 'ERROR', 'CRITICAL'
 
WEB_LOG_MAX_HEIGHT : integer, None : default=400
 - The maximum height, in pixles, of the web-log, before it scrolls
 - A value of None disables this restriction
 
WEB_DIGEST_USERNAME : text, None : default=None
 - The username to use for DIGEST-based authentication
 - If None, authentication is disabled
 
WEB_DIGEST_PASSWORD : text, None : default=None
 - The password to use for DIGEST-based authentication
 - If None, authentication is disabled
 
WEB_DASHBOARD_SECURE : boolean : default=False

EMAIL_ENABLED : boolean : False
 - Whether e-mail notification of 'CRITICAL'-severity events should occur
 - These issues usually reflect very unusual conditions in your network, and
   are therefore generally very helpful
   
EMAIL_SERVER : text : MUST BE SPECIFIED
 - Your SMTP server's address
 
EMAIL_PORT : integer : default=25
 - The SMTP port your server uses
 
EMAIL_TIMEOUT : decimal : default=4.0
